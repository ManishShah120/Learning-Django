# ModelForm

Till now we have learned to work with the help of **Form API**
Fomrm is API is redundant i.e., we need to write the sae line of of code several time i.e., in `forms.py`, `models.py`, `views.py`

From now omwards we will see a different approach.

## Some of the Model Field:
- AutoField
- BigAutoField
- BigIntegerField
- BinaryField
- BooleanField
- CharField
- DateField
- DateTimeField
- DecimalField
- DurationField
- EmailFild
- FileField

- FloatField
- ForeignKey
- ImageField
- IntegerField

- NullBooleanField
- PositiveIntegerField

- SlugField
- SmallAutoField
- SmallIntegerField
